My Projects

Typing Test:

Typing Websites make us an better Typist. For working on years on my typing I realize should make my own typing test for typing and important is whole control of website in own hand. That is why, most of the coders build there own product for customization. In my Typing Test I’ve added a **reset button** with useful and **productivity increasing functionality** added is that we can save our work until the site not reloaded after reload it will cleared whole content what after working own typing we can print/save it which should be send to teachers or instructors or anybody else to show that you are working on your typing.

Solving problems as a coder:

Working for many years in code I realized that I can solve my problems as a coder. 

Like making websites called MyLinks for all works or fun at same site. I make because, unfortunately, forget the name of websites make us difficult to recall or remember.

In Typing Test adding reset with saving data until the website reload and printing option make easy to show anybody want to check your progress in typing.

Making Captioner, it is easy to add, delete, edit or update captions and copy as JSON make easy to add in myPodcasts website.
