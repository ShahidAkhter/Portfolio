        <p>myLinks is a website created by me to prevent forgetting important website names or URLs that I frequently use.</p>
        <div class="text-size-4 text-color-2 font-bold">Evolution of myLinks</div>
        <p>The idea for myLinks came to me when I realized that I often forget the names of websites I frequently visit, making it difficult for me to remember them. Therefore, I came up with the concept of creating this website called myLinks.</p>
        <div class="text-size-4 text-color-2 font-bold">Useful Feature:</div>
        <p>This website not only allows you to create a collection of links but also provides a selection tag for categorizing them. By changing the selection tag's value, you can display only the links belonging to a specific category on the screen.</p>
